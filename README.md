# General-Game-Player
Final "player" created for Spring 2021 General Game Playing course (CS 227B). 

This project was created in partnership with Shimea Bridgewater (CS,'23) and Ricky Thai (CS, '24). Special thanks to the CS227B staff for providing the boilerplate code for the player (Sections before "player code goes here" and after "end of player code:).

In this course, our team designed a player which can take in a set of rules for a single or multiplayer game and play it, utilizing a Monte Carlo Tree Search approach, with a few extra bells and whistles (outlined in the report). The players first interprets the rules, then waits for the server to send a message detailing whose turn it now is, and what the last move was. The player then strategically parses the game tree and makes a move in the time allotted. The player must be a general one, and must be prepared to play any manner of game. Games played in class competitions ranged from simple (Tic-tac-toe) to fairly complex (chess).
